# Coding Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge - Horiseon 

## Description

The purpose of this project was to practice working with an established codebase and refactoring it to enhance accessibility and code readability. This project reinforced good coding practices by emphasizing the importance of using semantic HTML tags and following a semantic structure when organizing my code. It also provided the opportunity to hone my troubleshooting skillset and realize the importance of having accessibility at the forefront of a project design in order to enhance optimization from the very beginning of a project.
