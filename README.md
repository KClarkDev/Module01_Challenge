# Horiseon - Accessibility Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to practice working with an established codebase that was cloned from an existing Github repository and refactoring the code to enhance accessibility and code readability. This project reinforced good coding practices by emphasizing the importance of using semantic HTML tags and following a semantic structure when organizing code. It also provided the opportunity to hone my troubleshooting skillset and realize the importance of having accessibility at the forefront of a project design in order to enhance optimization from the very beginning of a project.
